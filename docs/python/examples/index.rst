===================
Examples & Concepts
===================

A loosely connected collection of examples and concepts useful for working with the Ouster Python
SDK. If you are just starting, please see :ref:`quickstart`.

For convenience, and in keeping with the :ref:`installation-python` and :ref:`quickstart` sections,
we will use ``$SAMPLE_DATA_PCAP_PATH`` and ``$SAMPLE_DATA_JSON_PATH`` for the locations of the
sample data pcap and json.  For python code, ``pcap_path`` and ``json_path`` are taken to be set to
those values, respectively.  Similarly, ``$SENSOR_HOSTNAME`` is used for your sensor's hostname.

The pictures below are captured from the `OS1 128 Rev 05 Urban Drive`_ sample data, though we
recommend that users download one of our :ref:`Rev 06 samples<sample-data-download>` instead.

Download Data
=============

..
   [start-download-instructions]

You can download sample data from the `sensor documentation`_ by clicking through the Ouster Data
App links and using the Download button. After download, you should have two files, a ``.pcap`` file
and a ``.json`` file.

We will use ``SAMPLE_DATA_PCAP_PATH`` to refer to this pcap and ``SAMPLE_DATA_JSON_PATH`` to this
json in the following.  You may find it convenient to assign the paths appropriately in your
console.

Visualize It!
=============

If you've installed the ``ouster-sdk`` (see :ref:`Python Installation <installation-python>`) then
you're all set to visualize with::
        
   $ ouster-cli source $SAMPLE_DATA_PCAP_PATH [--meta $SAMPLE_DATA_JSON_PATH] viz
       
You should get a view similar to:

.. figure:: /images/ouster-viz.png
    :align: center

    Ouster SDK CLI ``ouster-cli source <sensor | pcap | osf> viz`` visualization of OS1 128 sample data

You can control your visualizer with mouse and keyboard:

.. include:: /python/viz/viz-run.rst
    :start-after: [start-simple-viz-keymap]
    :end-before: [end-simple-viz-keymap]

Congratulations! You've installed and visualized with the Ouster Python SDK!

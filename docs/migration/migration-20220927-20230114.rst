===============================================
Migration from 20220927/0.5.1 to 20230114/0.7.1
===============================================

The 20230114 release, which corresponds to Python SDK 0.7.1, brings a few breaking changes
introduced to support the newest FW of the sensor, FW 3.0. The changes and how to mitigate them are
summarized here.

Signal Multiplier
-----------------

FW 3.0 allows setting the signal multiplier to non-int values 0.25 and 0.5. As such, we have changed
the type of the ``sensor_config`` struct member ``signal_multiplier`` to double. 

Old saved config jsons will continue to load properly.

XYZLut and ``sensor_info``
--------------------------

The ``sensor_info`` struct now contains the ``beam_to_lidar_transform`` specifying the relationship
between the beam coordinate frame and lidar coordinate frame. The double
``lidar_origin_to_beam_origin_mm`` which corresponds to the (0, 3) element of the
``beam_to_lidar_transform`` has not been removed.

The ``make_xyz_lut`` function now takes a ``mat4d`` transformation specifying the relation between
the beam and lidar coordinate frames, as opposed to the  previous double which assumed an Identity
rotation. 

Users using pre-FW3.0 sensors with the latest SDK ``make_xyz_lut`` overload which accepts a
``sensor_info`` need not change anything, as the ``sensor_info`` struct automatically derives and
self-populates with the appropriate ``beam_to_lidar_transform``.

Default Parameters in init_client
---------------------------------

The shortform C++ ``init_client`` and Python ``client.Sensor()`` no longer have default parameters.
Since they do not configure the sensor, it didn't make sense to default to any value for any
parameters. Users must provide the ports and hostname explicitly now.

Timeout Improvements
--------------------

The Python Scans interface timeout parameter has been changed from None to 1 second by default to
avoid confusing hanging behavior when timing out is appropriate. The default timeout has also been
changed to 2 seconds across the board.

Notes for the future
--------------------

For customers who know they will continue to upgrade their version of the SDK, we also wish to
highlight the upcoming breaking changes:

First, the next release will default writing the non-legacy metadata format as opposed to the
current format, also known as the legacy metadata format. The SDK will continue to read the legacy
format, i.e., it will continue to read old recorded data), and it will also be able to produce the
legacy format if the parameter ``legacy=true`` is specified to the ``get_metadata`` function.

Summary
=======
Currently only contains the sensor udp data checker utility used in the firmware integration
tests. You probably don't need to use this yet.

Contains two scripts: ``ouster-checker`` and ``ouster-example`` which are the sensor udp stream
checking utility and an example program using the python bindings, respectively.

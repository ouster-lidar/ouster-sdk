/**
 * \brief Reassembles fragmented IP packets.
 *
 * This class is fairly simple: just feed packets into it using
 * IPv4Reassembler::process. If the return value is IPv4Reassembler::FRAGMENTED,
 * then the packet is fragmented and we haven't yet seen the missing fragments,
 * hence we can't reassemble it. If the function returns either
 * IPv4Reassembler::NOT_FRAGMENTED (meaning the packet wasn't fragmented) or
 * IPv4Reassembler::REASSEMBLED (meaning the packet was fragmented but it's now
 * reassembled), then you can process the packet normally.
 *
 * Simple example:
 *
 * \code
 * IPv4Reassembler reassembler;
 * Sniffer sniffer = ...;
 * sniffer.sniff_loop([&](PDU& pdu) {
 *     // Process it in any case, unless it's fragmented (and can't be
 * reassembled yet) if (reassembler.process(pdu) != IPv4Reassembler::FRAGMENTED)
 * {
 *         // Now actually process the packet
 *         process_packet(pdu);
 *     }
 * });
 * \endcode

# OS1 Example Client

## Contents
* `ouster_client/` contains a simple C++ client for the OS1 sensor
* can be built both with and without ROS. See the instructions in
  `ouster_ros` for building in a ROS environment

## Building the Sample Client
* The sample client requires a compiler supporting C++11 or newer and
  CMake
* Build with `cd /path/to/ouster_example/ouster_client && mkdir build
  && cd build && cmake .. && make`

## Running the Sample Client
* The sample client includes a small driver program that just prints
  some data to the terminal
* Make sure the OS1 is connected to the network and has obtained a
  DHCP lease. See accompanying documentation for more details
* You should see a binary called `ouster_client_example` in your build
  directory on success
* Run `ouster_client_example <os1_hostname> <udp_data_dest_ip>` where
  `<os1_hostname>` is the hostname or IP address of the OS1 sensor,
  and `<udp_data_dest_ip>` is the IP to which the sensor should send
  lidar data
